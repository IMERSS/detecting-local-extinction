## Mapping potential habitat

In the previous habitat mapping vignette, we defined the extent of historical habitat, showing
how contextual knowledge can be used to manually override the automatic determination
based on coordinate uncertainty of the historical record and the site classification.

## Expanding the habitat grid to include potential habitat

The potential habitat for a species is determined by using the site classification
mapping described in [mapping habitat](../mapping_habitat). The potential habitat
is simply defined as the total valid habitat with the historical habitat substrated.
This potential habitat is designated ``pot`` in the statistical and geospatial
summary tables.
