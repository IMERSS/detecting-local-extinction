The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2012) has established
global standards for the assessment of extinction events.

>"The IUCN defines a taxon as ‘presumed extinct’ (in our case, equivalent to extirpated—or 
locally extinct) “when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at 
appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have 
failed to record an individual.” 

However, it remains a major challenge to determine the evidentiary thresholds implied by these 
criteria (‘exhaustive’, ‘expected’, ‘appropriate’), not only to clarify the formal requirements 
for claims regarding extirpation but also to inform effective search methods and to assess the feasibility 
of meeting these requirements.

Our goal is to transform the abstract problem of assessing extinction into a 
structured, measurable, and actionable process. To that end, this documentation 
clarifies the steps and assumptions underlying the IUCN extinction criteria and 
proposes a practical methodology for applying them to infer extinction events in 
real-world contexts.
